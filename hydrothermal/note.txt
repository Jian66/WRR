Run of river hydropower plants (daily regulation:日调节 in Chinese; no regulation:径流式 in Chinese) are not subject to optimization. For those run of river plants which located on the river without any storage hydropower plants, run of river plants which located on the very upstream of storage hydropower plants and run of river plants which lack the necessary data to calculate, their outputs are set as historical records and deducted from the load for hydrothermal system before optimization. So does the Xiluodu hydropower plant. For other run of river plants considered, their storages are fixed in the model.
