Gaussian.java is used to generate the forecast inflows. 

For Jan (there are minor differences compared to the code for other months):
L_YNHYDROINIT_O_1.lng is used to provide feasible solutions for hydropower plants.
L_YNHYDRO_O_1.lng is the hydro model.
L_YNTHERMAL_O_1.lng is the thermal model.
L_YNHYDROTHERMAL_O_1.lng is the hydrothermal model.
L_YNHYDROTHERMAL_S_1.lng is the simulation model.

From Feb to Dec (code are the same for these months, the following code are used for Feb, one need to copy these files and rename them for other months):
L_YNHYDROINIT_O_2.lng
L_YNHYDRO_O_2.lng
L_YNTHERMAL_O_2.lng
L_YNHYDROTHERMAL_O_2.lng
L_YNHYDROTHERMAL_S_2.lng

UpdateOpt.java is used to invoke the 60(5*12) operation files one by one automatically.
